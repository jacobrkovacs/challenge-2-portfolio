                Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Jacob and as of June 2023, I have just started my web development learning journey. I went to school for Criminal Justice but decided that career path was not for me. Instead of going back to school for another 4 years for a CS degree, I decided to enroll in the UC Davis Coding Bootcamp.

                A little about me: I am married and have three little girls. I enjoy designing and playing board games and card games. Some of my current favorites are Twilight Imperium: 4th Edition (TI4), Innovation and Terraforming Mars. I am currently prototyping two games that I have designed and will be in heavy playtesting one of them soon.
